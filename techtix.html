            <h1><span>What makes Espektro?</span></h1>
        <p>The kingdom Espektro is divided into two territories: Exotica - the Cultural Fest and Techtix - The Techno-Management Fest. The gala spans over four days in which the aspiring Engineers feed their technological appetite through events in robotics, science exhibition, hackathon and every other innovative technological bout a creative mind may think of. Besides, the geeks and the brainy wizards in games of chess, quizzing, debate, spell-bee, treasure hunt and a boundless gazette of brain stormer. Exotica, on the other hand, is the house to artistic talents, a haven for creative compositions. Starting right from T-shirt painting, face painting to the royal rumble of college bands, the reckless dance mob and to top them all, the guest performances.</p>

The clubs of KGEC, under the umbrella of the Students' Union, responsible for the nurture and cultivation of co-curriculars and extra-curriculars throughout the academic year, come together to pull off this extraordinary vibrance. And this year, with the extra tinge of the Silver Jubilee celebrations, we plan to make it even bigger and better.
